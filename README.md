# Objective
The objective of this project is to make a website using Streamlit.
# Features of the Website
 - Load the CSV file that contains the data
 - Remove any unnecessary item in the data frame by selecting it
 - Select the output of the model from the data frame
 - Automatically detect and encode any columns that contain strings
 - Determine the percentage of training data from the whole data
 - scaling the data with various algorithm
 - Select the between regression and classification
 - Select between different algorithms in regression and classification
 - Automatically tunning the model hyperparameter
 - Ability to download the trained Model as .pkl
